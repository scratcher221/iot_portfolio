# Lecture Report 1

## Some facts about my programming experience:

- I went to BG/BRG Amstetten before joining FH Hagenberg, where I was in the IT branch. There we worked with PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Out of the well known programming languages, we covered C++ and C#.

- In my free time I did a lot of Python scripting as a child, and throughout school up until college.

- In Hagenberg I first came into contact with coding smart contracts in Solidity, which became my favorite programming language.

## Micro controller experience:

- In the course HNP in Hagenberg, we worked with the TI MSP432 micro controller with an ARM processor. The main project was programming it in such a way, that it could be used as a bike computer which shows distance, speed, and time.


## Single board computers:

- I also have some experience with Raspberry Pi, both in my free time (I use one as a home NAS), and during my time at BG/BRG Amstetten.


## Knowledge about IoT:

- I had some superficial knowledge about IOT before this class, especially in the context of cryptocurrencies like IOTA, which makes it possible for devices to conduct micropayments with each other. Also, some knowledge about IOT regarding, cars (phone communicating personal data to the car, e.g. Tesla) and home automation.

## Expectations from this clas:

- I expect to learn a lot about IoT, to understand it more deeply. Right now my knowledge about this subject is rather limited, and I would like to grasp it more deeply and also learn how to apply it in home projects that are useful for everyday life.



## The Internet of Things Definition.

Source 1: Wikipedia (Internet der Dinge)
The IoT is a term which describes the linking of real physical objects to a multitude of global networks. This enables those objects to communicate with each other to assist humans in everyday tasks. The term was first described in an essay by Mark Weiser, called “The Computer for the 21st Century”.

Applications.
Some important applications of this technology are Smart Homes, Smart Cities, connected cars and wearables.

The IoT is a network of physical objects like vehicles, machines and houshold appliances which, equipped with sensors and linked via APIS to the internet, exchange Data with each other.

The protocols used are very spread out and diverse, so it is very hard to nail it down to a precise definition.
