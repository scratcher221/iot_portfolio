# Contemplation on Lab 5

In the 5<sup>th</sup> lab exercise we started working on the first project. We thought up a nice little scenario in a bank, which involves some sensors and actors. 

- Problems:
We didn't get too much done during the time in the lab, because we were still struggling with writing all the reports from the previous exercises. However, at least we managed to set all the sensors up to get data from them, and to control the relay. We finished project 1 out of class because of the lack of time.
