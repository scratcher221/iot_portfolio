# Contemplation on Lab 7

In this lab exercise we finished rebuilding project 1 in UlnoIoT. There were some issues with deploying code to the nodes. The reason seemed to be that the wemos devices were in some locked state and didn't accept flashing. Manually resetting the wemoses by pushing the reset button on it worked. We also had to modify the layout in Node-RED slightly, because it didn't work as expected on the first try after flashing all the nodes.
The final layout in Node-RED, and also the setup in hardware can be found in the corresponding lab report.
