# Contemplation on Lab 3

## Exercise 1 (COAP)

We installed the "Copper4Cr" extension on Chromium on a Linux system. The extension could not be found in the official Chrome Web Store, we had to clone the git repository locally and then manually add the extension in "chrome://extensions" via "Load unpacked". Following the instructions from the git repo, this worked without problems.

The "Copper4Cr" extension has an easy to use GUI, however we had some issues controlling the LED, as we were not sure if it was LOW active or HIGH active at first.

## Exercise 2 (MQTT)

We installed the MQTT.fx application version 1.7.1. After some initial configurations we had a nice GUI and were able to try it out by sending data in the "Publish/Subscribe" pattern.

After this, we built some simulators in Java (temperature, relay, integrator). Details of this can be found in the corresponding lab report.
