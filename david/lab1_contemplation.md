# Contemplation on Lab 1

## Raspberry Pi

The first lab exercise consisted mostly of setting up the Raspberry Pi, so we can use it later. First of all, we had to flash the operating system onto the SD card. I was already familiar with this process, as I have used Raspberry Pis personally for home applications. The image was flashed using the software "Etcher", which has an easy to use graphical user interface.

Configuring the Pi was also pretty straightforward, we simply adjusted some parameters for the WiFi network (network name, username and password), and then we were able to connect.

## Arduino

Working with the Arduino IDE is quite familiar, as I was already used to coding in C and C++ from other classes. There were no significant problems during the process other than a broken cable.
