# Contemplation on Lab 2

## Exercise 1 (IFTTT WebHook)

The first exercise consisted of pressing a button and subsequently triggering a HTTP POST request via a IFTTT WebHook. In my experience, this was very easy once we figured out which app we had to use, since both of us were already familiar with how the HTTP protocol works. I downloaded the app on my Android phone and created a WebHook there. The app is quite easy to use, because it is intuitive. A simple if "this" then "that" template is provided. For the "this" I created the WebHook, and for the "that" I selected the IFTT app notification that should be sent to my phone.

Although we did encounter some problems (see lab report), overall I found the app easy to use and once we figured things out it all went pretty smoothly.

## Exercise 2 (LCD Display)

The second exercise was to control a LCD display over some software written in the Arduino IDE. We quickly found a tutorial that we could easily follow, so we didn't really enounter any problems at all. For testing purposes, the message "Hello World" was printed to the display.
