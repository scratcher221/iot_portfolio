# 1. Lecture

What type of programming experience?
- I’ve done HTL Perg before I came to college, so I have a bit of programming experience. Programming languages like Java and C#. 
- Besides college I do work at Webonia, a company that does webdesign. Most of the time I do program PHP and JavaScript there.

What have you done with micro controllers? (Like Arduino..)
- Nothing special. Just a course that was held last semester where we have done something with it.

Single board Computers
- Yeah, I’ve worked with Raspberry PI before. I want to build a small Home Automation/Monitoring System next year.

Who is a maker of part of a maker community?

What do you already know about IoT?
- It’s a term that is getting a big hype nowadays. Almost every company tries to get into the IoT- market.

What are your expectations from this class?
- Honestly, I don’t have any real expectations, except of being something different to other lectures, which is kind of interesting.

What does the Internet of Things entail?
- Connecting things (that don't have to be specific intented to be connected) to the internet.
- Making this things communicate with each other allows to gather data that hasn't really been gathered before.
- Also, you could sell that data to other third parties.

Use laptop to google about IoT, find and note down including small description (submit as participation proof at end of class):
– 3 domains (included areas): 
--Cryptocurrencies: For example IOTA, connecting machines together to a network, enabling 
--Home Automation: To control window blinds, turning on and off the lights from away is a thing that comes in my mind when thinking of the IoT.
--Security control: To gain/restrict access to different areas

–2 commonly used (data) protocols: 
--MQTT
--Modbus

– 2 typical devices (appliance or controller): 
-- Smart lock door
-- Bluetooth Trackers
-- Smart Meter (energy)
-- Voice Assistance
-- Phillips Hue

Challenges?
-Scaling, because a lot of data is gathered.
-Security, because the companies had several issues with it
-Machine-To-Machine growing slower than expected
-There is not a real standard for IOT.
