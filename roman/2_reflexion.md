# 2. Reflexion

* Lecture:
    * I had to research the ports on my own, cause I've missed the first 15 minutes of the lecture, unfortunately.
    * writing the project ideas was harder than expected, cause it was hard to agree on something


* Exercise:
    * Our kit is missing quite a few items. We'll have to speak to Ulno to get a new kit.
