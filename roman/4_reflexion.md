# 3. Reflexion

* Lecture:
    * I didn't know that the Consortiums/Foundations/Alliances take so much money from participants! Wow-Effect.
    * Today we've heard something abou LoRa, maybe I can use that one to speak to my garage-device? (Mentioned in reflection 1)


* Exercise:
    * I've written to Ulno about the kit problem. We've got the missing items now.
	* BUILTIN LED is LOW ACTIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!! which means, writing 0 to that output switches it on... definitely a thing to remember ;)
    * MQTT Naming is hard to refactor, don't trust the IDEA. It will search for every string you've written. If changing that, you will have to change every other string too.
