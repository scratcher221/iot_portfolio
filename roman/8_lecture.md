## Iot - What could break?
### What did already break?
* DDoS attacks might be very harmful  
* T2000% jump in ransomware detection
* WIFI Cameras arent really secure
* Home Security Devices may not be as secure as they seem


### What will break?
* Password change too often
* Password gets published somewhere
* replay attack on WiFi-Protected Access
* WPA is not secured


## Threats & Attacks
### Companies
* Don't take enough care of security
* most of the time taking time for security happens too late, after the attack has already been done.

### Wifi attacks
* Deauth attack
 - Disconnects every device not using IEEE 802.11w
* Crack attack
 - All data of clients can be read in a WPA2 Wifi
 
 
### Cyber Abuse
* Domesitc Abuse when households are struggling (password changes, spying, controlling devices)

### Man in the middle
* Attacker interrupts communication and acts as the communication partner to the other
* Sender doesn't know that there is a "man in the middle" that is reading the messages and maybe modifying them.

### Action Points
* Data sharing on attacks between stake holders
* Fixed sanctions for breaking security
* Standardisation for companies building IoT to improve security

### Arguments for continuing use of IoT
* Increased health, safety and accessibility for people
* Smarter devices which increase living standard
* real-time marketing
* reduced mistakes made by humans
