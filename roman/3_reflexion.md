# 3. Reflexion

* Lecture:
    * I didn't know that the Consortiums/Foundations/Alliances take so much money from participants! Wow-Effect.
    * Today we've heard something abou LoRa, maybe I can use that one to speak to my garage-device? (Mentioned in reflection 1)


* Exercise:
    * I've written to Ulno about the kit problem. We've got the missing items now.
