# 1. Reflexion
* Lecture:
    * first impression is quite nice, already having some project ideas
    * garage opening system via wlan??


* Exercise:
    * easy, cause I had already experience with Etcher
    * although, downloading the linux image was quite annoying cause the internet broke down, again...
