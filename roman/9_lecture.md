## LoRa Youtube Video
- band is free to use
- there are multiple bands for europe, china, usa
- very low throughput
- uplink (device to gateway) has more speed than other way around
- a sensor always needs a lora sender

## Lora Google

- What is link budget?
    - In german: Leistungs√ºbertragungsbilanz
    - accounting of all the gains and losses from the transmitter through the medium

- Google Radio link budget calculator
    - Do two calculations for lora and for wifi
    - note down results
	- Pasternack's Link Budget Calculator determines the received signal strength (in dBm) given a systems amplifier gains, antenna gains and space loss.

- lora in austria and linz
    - Austria has 81 gateways connected all around austria
    - Austria started off nice with 9 communities
    - There are some sensors in linz

- how expensive is a lora client adapter, a lora gateway
    - it depends, a full dragino with a gateway costs 65 eur, a lora arduino module is like 9 euros.

- lora software support

- discuss with neighbor
    - what is lora good for, what might it be bad at
        - Transmitting small data like sensor data
        - Bad for live-streaming, for example
    - what are its advantages, short comings
    - how does it fit into iot
        - Perfect for exchanging sensor data for sensors that aren't reachable via wifi.

## TTN
- Single research
    - The things network
    - Set of open tools and global, open network to build IoT applications at low cost, featuring maximum security and ready to scale
- What is TTN (in connection with LoRa)?
    - The Things Network is a proud contributor member of the LoRa Alliance.
    - We offer an extensive amount of resources to get you up and running with LoRaWAN and The Things Network. You can check them out below.
    - Volunteers spread technology and provide support for LoRa
    - You don't have to buy the expensive gateways
- What does it stand for?
    - The Things Network
- Which problems does it solve?
    - If you don't have LoRa Gateways, you can simply use a TTN gateway imo
- How does it solve them?
